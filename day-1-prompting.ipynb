You don't need to read the whitepaper to use this notebook, but the papers will give you some theoretical context and background to complement this interactive notebook.\n\n\n## Before you begin\n\nIn this notebook, you'll start exploring prompts and prompt parameters using the Python SDK and AI Studio. For some inspiration, you might enjoy exploring some apps that have been built using the Gemini family of models. Here are a few that we like, and we think you will too.\n\n* [TextFX](https://textfx.withgoogle.com/) is a suite of AI-powered tools for rappers, made in collaboration with Lupe Fiasco,\n* [SQL Talk](https://sql-talk-r5gdynozbq-uc.a.run.app/) shows how you can talk directly to a database using the Gemini API,\n* [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/) uses Gemini models to build your own personal AI research assistant.\n\n\n### A note on the Gemini API and Vertex AI\n\nIn the whitepapers, most of the example code uses the Enterprise [Vertex AI platform](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai). In contrast, this notebook, along with the others in this series, will use the [Gemini Developer API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/) and [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).\n\nBoth APIs provide access to the Gemini family of models, and the code to interact with the models is very similar. Vertex provides a world-class platform for enterprises, governments and advanced users that need powerful features like data governance, ML ops and deep Google Cloud integration.\n\nAI Studio is free to use and only requires a compatible Google account to log in and get started. It is deeply integrated with the Gemini API, which comes with a generous [free tier](https://ai.google.dev/pricing) that you can use to run the code in these exercises.\n\nIf you are already set up with Google Cloud, you can check out the [Enterprise Gemini API](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/model-reference/inference) through Vertex AI, and run the samples directly from the supplied whitepapers.","metadata":{"id":"csNPnkuCobmG"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Get started with Kaggle notebooks\n\nIf this is your first time using a Kaggle notebook, welcome!

Bart, seized by a sudden surge of courage, slipped through the gap and into the world. The city was a dizzying maze of scents, sounds, and sights. He cautiously explored the alleyways, dodging oversized boots and scavenging for scraps. He discovered a hidden garden, bursting with fragrant flowers, where he met a wise old tabby named Horace, who shared tales of his own escapades.\n\nBart’s adventure took him across the park, where he encountered a mischievous squirrel who led him on a thrilling chase. He even found himself on a bustling street, where he narrowly avoided being stepped on by a speeding bicycle. He learned to navigate the city’s rhythm, to understand the language of pigeons and the secret paths of alley cats.\n\nOne night, he found himself lost and alone. Exhausted and hungry, he longed for the warmth of his home. He began to miss the familiar smells of his favorite scratching post and the gentle purr of his human companion. \n\nAs the first rays of dawn peeked through the city, a familiar scent drifted through the air. It was the smell of his favorite catnip, a scent that led him back to his apartment building.  With a final leap, he was back home, safe and sound. \n\nBart had learned many lessons on his adventure. He had tasted freedom, conquered his fears, and discovered the strength within himself. He returned a changed cat, his eyes sparkling with new experiences. He still longed for adventure, but now he knew that even the most exciting journey could lead him back to the comfort and love of home.\n\nFrom then on, whenever he looked out the window, Bart saw the city with a new perspective. He saw not just a bustling metropolis, but a vast playground of possibilities, a place where adventures awaited, just beyond the reach of his paws.

The back door, usually kept firmly shut, stood ajar. With a mischievous glint in his eye, he slipped out, the world a symphony of scents and sounds he'd never experienced before.\n\nThe garden, usually a familiar haven, was now a vast, unexplored jungle. He stalked through the tall grass, his whiskers twitching with excitement, the scent of damp earth and blooming roses filling his nostrils. He chased butterflies, their wings like stained glass against the sun, and pounced on unsuspecting beetles, their exoskeletons crunching under his paws.\n\nHis adventure led him to the edge of the woods, a dark and mysterious place that held both fear and fascination. He hesitated, his instincts screaming caution, but the lure of the unknown was too strong. He ventured in, the sunlight filtering through the leaves, creating dappled patterns on the forest floor.\n\nHe encountered a family of squirrels, their bushy tails twitching with alarm, and a grumpy badger, who grunted at him before disappearing into his burrow. He even caught a glimpse of a deer, its graceful form disappearing into the undergrowth.\n\nAs the sun began to set, casting long shadows across the forest floor, Bartholomew felt a pang of loneliness. He missed the warmth of Agnes's lap, the comforting rhythm of her heartbeat. He missed the familiar scent of her lavender soap.\n\nHe retraced his steps, the forest now a menacing place in the fading light. He found his way back to the garden, his heart pounding with relief. Agnes, worried sick, was waiting for him by the back door. She scooped him up in her arms, her voice trembling with relief.\n\nBartholomew, nestled in her embrace, felt a surge of contentment. He had tasted adventure, but he realized that home, with its warmth and love, was where he truly belonged. He purred, a deep, rumbling sound that spoke of both contentment and a newfound appreciation for the simple joys of life.\n\nFrom that day on, Bartholomew continued to dream of adventures, but he also learned to appreciate the comfort of his cozy windowsill, knowing that even the most exciting journeys always lead back to the place where you are truly loved. \n\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"model = genai.GenerativeModel(\n    'gemini-1.5-flash-001',\n    generation_config=genai.GenerationConfig(\n        # These are the default values for gemini-1.5-flash-001.\n        temperature=1.0,\n        top_k=1,\n        top_p=0.99,\n    ))\n\nstory_prompt = \"You are a creative writer.

Barnaby followed the scent, his tail twitching, until he found a small, open bag sitting on the counter. A bag full of spices. \n\nHe batted the bag with his paw, sending a cloud of fragrant powder into the air. It tickled his nose, and the urge to explore, to leap into the unknown, roared within him.

The passage led him through a labyrinth of tunnels and secret rooms. Finally, he emerged into a vibrant, bustling marketplace. \n\nThe air buzzed with a cacophony of languages, the stalls overflowed with exotic wares, and a kaleidoscope of colors painted the scene. Barnaby, wide-eyed and awed, was no longer just a bored cat.
